# YUSynth-VC-Stereo-Mixer

This is my eurorack adaptation of the Mixout-VC Panner from YUSynth. I've ommited
the headphone out the VU meters. This is done because to compact the boards a bit
and to save space on the panels.

I've broken it up into 3 boards, one VoiceBoard for every channel, a mainboard 
containing the mixer and the Bass & Trebble and finally small daughter board for the
left/right output jacks.

The breaks up of the boards is done in such a way that you can decide for yourself
how many channels/voice you want to add.
